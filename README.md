# Dynamic-Branch-Prediction-GA--NTB
The branch predictor algorithms can be classified into two main classes; static and dynamic. Static predictors are simple and rely on software where dynamic predictors are complex and rely on hardware . Dynamic predictors show more accuracy than static predictors because they learn the repetitive pattern of change in branch direction although they need time for worming up .
